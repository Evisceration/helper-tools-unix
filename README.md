# helper-tools-unix

Nothing too interesting, just some helper tools, which suits my development workflow.


Because i multi boot between different unix systems (Fedora, macOS, Ubuntu Server, to name a few), i like
to apply all changes done to my tools easily via git.


Basically i clone this somewhere (usually ```/opt/bin``` or ```/Users/amartinz/workspace/bin``` on macOS) and add it to my PATH.
